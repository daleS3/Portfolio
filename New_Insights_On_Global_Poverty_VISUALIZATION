```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

##Setup
```{r gapminder}
library(dslabs)
data(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```

##Scatter Plot Snapshot of 1962
```{r gapminder}
ds_theme_set()
filter(gapminder, year == 1962) %>% ggplot(aes(fertility,life_expectancy)) + geom_point()
###There appears to be two distinct clusters. One in the upper left, and the other in the lower right.

###Viewing data by continent
filter(gapminder, year == 1962) %>% ggplot(aes(fertility,life_expectancy, color = continent)) + geom_point()
###In 1962, the world appeared to be divided between the east and west. 
```

##Faceting 
```{r gapminder}
###Faceting by year and continent
filter(gapminder, year%in%c(1962, 2012)) %>% ggplot(aes(fertility,life_expectancy, col = continent)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(continent~year)

filter(gapminder, year%in%c(1962, 2012)) %>% ggplot(aes(fertility,life_expectancy, col = continent)) + geom_point() + facet_grid(.~year) 
###The eastern world is catching up to western life expectancies and fertility rates 

###Exploring multiple years by wrapping a series of plots
years <- c(1962, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2012)
continents <- c("Europe", "Asia")
filter(gapminder, year%in% years & continent%in%continents) %>% ggplot(aes(fertility,life_expectancy, col = continent)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~year) 
###Asian countries have made significant improvement 
```

##Time series analysis
```{r gapminder}
##US only
gapminder %>% filter(country == "United States") %>% ggplot(aes(year, fertility)) + geom_line()

##Multiple countries 
countries <- c("South Korea", "Germany")
gapminder %>% filter(country %in% countries) %>% ggplot(aes(year,fertility)) + geom_line()

###Separating lines
countries <- c("South Korea", "Germany")
gapminder %>% filter(country %in% countries) %>% ggplot(aes(year,fertility, col = country)) + geom_line()

###Adding labels and viewing life expectancy
labels <- data.frame(country = countries, x = c(1975, 1965), y = c(60,72))
gapminder %>% filter(country %in% countries) %>% ggplot(aes(year,life_expectancy, col = country)) + geom_line() + geom_text(data = labels, aes(x, y, label = country), size = 5) + theme(legend.position = "none")
###The life expectancy gap closed by 2010
```

##Implementing transformations to understand income
```{r gapminder}
gapminder <- gapminder %>% mutate(dollars_per_day = gdp/population/365)

past_year <- 1970
gapminder %>% filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>% ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")

#Applying log transformation to easily see the various categories of poor to very rich countries
#log base 2 means that for every time the value doubles, the log transformation increase by 1.

gapminder %>% filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>% ggplot(aes(log2(dollars_per_day))) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black")
##There are two local modes (the two highest points), one at $2 and another at $32 dollars per day. 
##Try not to use natural log, but Log2 or Log10.
##Log2 for tighter ranges and Log10 for wider ranges, like population

##Transforming the data with scaling
gapminder %>% filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>% ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2")
##Advantage of doing this is that we will see the original x values, instead of the log values.
```

##Stratifying with boxplots
```{r gapminder}
##Observing how many regions
length(levels(gapminder$region))

##22 regions is too large for histograms, boxplots will be more effective

p <- gapminder %>% filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>% ggplot(aes(region, dollars_per_day))
p + geom_boxplot()

##Rotating the labels
p + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
##There's a west vs rest dichotomy 

##Reordering data from alphabetical to something more meaningful 
##Demonstration 
fac <- factor(c("Asia", "Asia", "West", "West", "West"))
levels(fac)
value <- c(10, 11, 12, 6, 4)
fac <- reorder(fac, value, FUN = mean)
levels(fac)
##West is first because it has a smaller mean value
##Gapminder Data
p <- gapminder %>% filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>% mutate(region = reorder(region, dollars_per_day, FUN = median)) %>% ggplot(aes(region, dollars_per_day, fill = continent)) + geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + xlab("")

p

##Changing to log2 scale

p + scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2")

##Adding points since there is not too much
p + scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2") + geom_point(show.legend = FALSE)

##Rich countries are primarily in the west
```

##Comparing distributions 
```{r gapminder}
west <- c("Western Europe", "Northern Europe", "Southern Europe", "Northern America", "Australia and New Zealand")

#Comparing distributions across time, splitting it into two groups
gapminder %>% filter(year == past_year & !is.na(gdp)) %>% mutate(group = ifelse(region%in%west, "West", "Developing")) %>%  ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + facet_grid(.~group)
##Clearly the countries in the west have higher incomes

##Comparing 1970 and 2010
past_year <- 1970
present_year <- 2010
gapminder %>% filter(year %in% c(past_year, present_year) & !is.na(gdp)) %>% mutate(group = ifelse(region%in%west, "West", "Developing")) %>% ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + facet_grid(year~group)
##Developing nations are improving more aggressively than the west.

##Remaking the plots, just using countries that have data in both 1970 and 2020
country_list_1 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == past_year & !is.na(dollars_per_day)) %>% .$country
country_list_2 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == present_year & !is.na(dollars_per_day)) %>% .$country
country_list <- intersect(country_list_1, country_list_2)

gapminder %>% filter(year %in% c(past_year, present_year) & country%in%country_list) %>% mutate(group = ifelse(region%in%west, "West", "Developing")) %>% ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + facet_grid(year~group)
#Developing nations have shift more to the right than the richer nations. 

##Making a boxplot to view which regions are developing the most.
p <- gapminder %>% filter(year%in%c(past_year, present_year) & country%in%country_list) %>% mutate(region = reorder(region, dollars_per_day, FUN = median)) %>% ggplot() + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + xlab("") + scale_y_continuous(trans = "log2")

p + geom_boxplot(aes(region, dollars_per_day, fill = continent)) + facet_grid(year~.)

##Cleaning up the comparisons to see what countries improved the most
p + geom_boxplot(aes(region, dollars_per_day, fill = factor(year)))
```

##Using smooth density plots to convey message more clearly
```{r gapminder}
##We need to find evidence that developing nations are improving and not that rich countries are declining

##Viewing the differences in size of each category
gapminder %>% filter( year == past_year & country %in% country_list) %>% mutate(group = ifelse(region%in%west, "West", "Developing")) %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(n=n()) %>% knitr::kable()

##Making the areas proportional to the size of the groups with ".."
p <- gapminder %>% filter(year%in% c(past_year, present_year) & country%in%country_list) %>% mutate(group = ifelse(region%in%west, "West", "Developing")) %>% ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, y = ..count.., fill = group)) + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") 

p + geom_density(alpha = 0.2) + facet_grid(year~.)
##Now we can see that the developing world has more countries

##Making the density plot smoother
p + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, bw = 0.75) + facet_grid(year~.)
##It is now clear to see that the developing world is improving much more quickly than the west.

##Focusing on regions with "case_when"
gapminder <- gapminder %>% mutate(group = case_when(.$region%in% west ~ "West", .$region%in%c("Eastern Asia", "South-East Asia") ~ "East Asia", .$region%in% c("Caribean", "Central America", "South America") ~ "Latin America", .$continent == "Africa" & .$region != "Northern Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan Africa", TRUE ~ "Others"))
##Above we assigned groups by region

##Changing groups to factors, in order to control the levels
gapminder <- gapminder %>% mutate(group = factor(group, levels = c("Others", "Latin America", "East Asia", "Sub-Saharan Africa", "West")))

##Using a stacking approach to make a clear density plot, also adding "weight" to make sure proportions are accounted for
gapminder %>% filter(year%in%c(past_year, present_year) & country%in%country_list) %>% group_by(year) %>% mutate(weight = population/sum(population)*2) %>% ungroup() %>% ggplot(aes(dollars_per_day, fill = group, weight = weight)) + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2") + geom_density(alpha = 0.2, bw = 0.75, position = "stack") + facet_grid(year~.)
##The order of Others to West was intentional 

##The results shows that the income gap is closing, with most poor countries remaining in Africa.
```

##Describing the variability with comparing country child mortality rates and income
```{r gapminder}
##Creating new regions with case_when
gapminder <- gapminder %>% mutate(group = case_when(.$region%in%west ~ "The West", .$region%in% "Northern Africa" ~ "Northern Africa", .$region %in% c("Eastern Asia", "South-East Asia") ~ "East Asia", .$region == "Southern Asia" ~ "Southern Asia", .$region%in%c("Central America", "South America", "Caribbean")~ "Latin America", .$continent == "Africa" & .$region != "Northern Africa" ~ "Sub-Saharan Africa", .$region %in% c("Melanesia", "Micronesia", "Polynesia") ~ "Pacific Islands"))

##Computing quantities for each region
surv_income <- gapminder %>% filter(year%in% present_year & !is.na(gdp) & !is.na(infant_mortality) & !is.na(group)) %>% group_by(group) %>% summarize(income = sum(gdp)/sum(population)/365, infant_survival_rate = 1-sum(infant_mortality/1000*population)/sum(population))

surv_income %>% arrange(income)
##The relationship between income and child mortality rates are linear

surv_income %>% ggplot(aes(income, infant_survival_rate, label = group, color = group)) + scale_x_continuous(trans = "log2", limit = c(0.25,150)) + scale_y_continuous(trans = "logit", limit = c(0.875, 0.9981), breaks = c(0.85, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99, 0.995, 0.998)) + geom_label(size = 3, show.legend = FALSE)
##When we have estimates between 1 and 0, we will use logit

##The results so the linear relationship, but it is important to remember there can be wide variability within each region.
```
